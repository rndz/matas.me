Hey, I am Algirdas(or just Algis for short). I am a web developer who used to
work with Python and PHP before, but nowadays I prefer to work with Go!
Also I love traveling a lot and recently I took up running.

This will be a place to share whatever interests me at the moment. It
might be programming related, it might be about my latests travels or races
I competed in, or it might be something totally random that I find interesting
at the moment!
